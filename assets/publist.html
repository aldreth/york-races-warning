This Grade II listed building was probably purpose-built as a pub/hotel in the 1870s and survives as a multi-roomed public house, despite some remodelling in the 1930s which removed partitioning from the main bar. It still retains the original Victorian bar with its renowned Lighthorseman lantern, large windows and high ceilings. French doors lead from the dining area at the rear into an attractive beer garden. One of three Thwaites’ tied houses in York.<br>
